//! Streaming user-directory search over the live web of trust.
//!
//! [`MarmotApp::search_users`] answers "who do I know called *foo*" by walking
//! the searcher's own social graph outward and streaming matches as each layer
//! resolves, while a bounded Open Ranking request supplies off-graph discovery.
//! Graph results retain priority and social provenance; only remaining ranked
//! pubkeys are hydrated from signed Nostr profile events.
//!
//! Traversal is bounded by construction, as `AGENTS.md` requires: the radius is
//! capped, relay work per radius is batched author-scoped fetches under a
//! timeout, and the producer stops the moment its consumer drops the
//! subscription. Nothing here writes `directory_users` — strangers surfaced by
//! search stay un-promoted so they can never become live per-author
//! subscriptions (mdk#418).
//!
//! The synchronous [`MarmotApp::search_user_directory`] remains the offline
//! path over already-cached follow edges; this module is the live one.
