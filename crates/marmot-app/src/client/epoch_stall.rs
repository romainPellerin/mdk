//! Detection policy for epoch-gap backfill (commit-loss recovery).
//!
//! A device that misses a single commit sits stuck below its group's live
//! epoch: it keeps receiving that group's later-epoch traffic but cannot decrypt
//! any of it — the kind-445 envelope is sealed under the per-epoch exporter
//! secret and carries no cleartext epoch, so every such message fails to peel.
//! This detector turns that otherwise-invisible signal into a per-group "the
//! group moved on without me" decision *without ever decrypting the traffic*: it
//! counts the distinct undecryptable messages a group accumulates while its
//! epoch does not advance, and signals a backfill once that count crosses a
//! threshold.
//!
//! It also decides when that recovery is not working. A device can arm backfill
//! after backfill and still trail the group — the replay recovers some backlog,
//! the device advances an epoch, and the next epoch stalls just the same. The
//! detector counts the arms in such a run and escalates once it reaches
//! [`EPOCH_STALL_ESCALATION_ARM_THRESHOLD`], so the runtime can report a group
//! that full-history replay cannot repair instead of retrying it silently.
//!
//! What the detector counts is bounded by what it is told. Its only view of a
//! group's local epoch is the epoch handed to its own `observe_*` calls, so an
//! advance nobody reports leaves it believing the group never moved. Movement
//! reaches it as an epoch *passage*
//! ([`EpochStallDetector::observe_epoch_passage`]) — the engine's own
//! `EpochChanged` — so a device that recovers can end its own run even across
//! epochs no delivery was ever read at. Only a convergence reorg spans more than
//! one epoch in a single passage; a confirmed local publish and a folded peer
//! commit each advance exactly one, which is why the adjacency rule in
//! [`EpochStallDetector::observe_epoch_passage`] must stay a *delayed* reset and
//! not no reset at all.
//!
//! A group whose reported epoch never moves at all is the one shape that rule
//! cannot report, because every arm after the first needs that epoch to change
//! and the missing commit is the only thing that would change it. That group
//! gets a second rule, on a second kind of evidence. Its same-epoch re-arms are
//! paced on a wall clock
//! ([`EPOCH_STALL_WEDGE_REARM_INTERVAL_MS`]) — each one buys another
//! full-history replay, because a replay is the only thing that can learn
//! anything new — and it escalates once
//! [`EPOCH_STALL_FRUITLESS_COMPLETION_THRESHOLD`] of those replays have come
//! back end-of-stored-events confirmed and empty
//! ([`EpochStallDetector::observe_fruitless_completion`]). Counting the relays'
//! verdicts rather than the arms is what keeps the minted-traffic property
//! below: garbage can pace attempts, it cannot forge a relay's confirmation
//! that it served everything it had.
//!
//! Runs are bounded in wall-clock too. Nothing else ends a quiet group's run,
//! so two arms more than [`EPOCH_STALL_RUN_CONTINUATION_WINDOW_MS`] apart are
//! two runs, not one — an unrelated stall weeks after a single arm starts fresh
//! rather than landing as arm two of something long dead.
//!
//! The arm run is process-local, like the stall counts it extends. The
//! frozen-epoch evidence is not: a group with nothing to re-arm on but the
//! clock earns at most one confirmed fruitless replay per pacing interval, so a
//! device restarted more often than that would never reach the threshold at
//! all. (A group whose replay keeps *refusing* its history re-arms off those
//! refusals instead, unpaced, and reaches the threshold faster.) That evidence
//! and the
//! wall-clock mark of the last arm are persisted per group and restored at
//! account open ([`EpochStallDetector::restore_wedge_evidence`]). Wall-clock
//! deliberately: the counter survives a restart, but the restart never becomes
//! the re-arm clock.
//! `sync_with_partial_progress` moves a one-shot escalation into either its
//! success summary or its failure prefix before the managed runtime can rebuild
//! the client. The compatibility `sync()` API instead leaves it stashed after
//! an error so a caller retaining that client receives it on the next successful
//! seam. A caller that discards such a client also discards the detector run;
//! the opt-in `epoch_stall_backfill_escalated` audit row is then the only durable
//! trace.
//!
//! A discarded run is re-earned from zero rather than re-raised: escalating
//! again costs a whole fresh run of [`EPOCH_STALL_ESCALATION_ARM_THRESHOLD`]
//! arms, and only the first can land at the epoch the device already sits at,
//! because an arm at an epoch already fired at is skipped until the pacing
//! interval elapses. A group still reporting epoch advances therefore escalates
//! again once the run refills — delayed, not lost — and a frozen group reports
//! off its restored evidence instead.
//!
//! The policy is deliberately I/O-free so it can be unit-tested in isolation;
//! the recovery action it triggers — a full-history transport replay — lives in
//! the caller, which owns the runtime.
