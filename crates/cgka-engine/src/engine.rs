//! [`Engine<S>`] is the OpenMLS-backed [`CgkaEngine`] implementation.
//!
//! Generic over `S: cgka_traits::StorageProvider`. Holds OpenMLS RustCrypto
//! for the crypto + rand half of OpenMLS's provider surface, materializing an
//! `EngineOpenMlsProvider` on demand per MLS call.
//!
//! This file owns construction, trait dispatch, event drains, and small
//! read-only helpers. Group creation, ingest/send, publish lifecycle,
//! convergence, and capability logic live in focused sibling modules.
