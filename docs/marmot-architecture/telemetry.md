# Telemetry, Logging, and Tracing Inventory

This is a source-grounded inventory of the telemetry, logging, and tracing surfaces currently present in the app
runtime. It complements the policy docs:

- [`overview/observability.md`](./overview/observability.md) defines what runtime tracing/logging may contain.
- [`relay-delivery-telemetry.md`](./relay-delivery-telemetry.md) explains the relay/convergence measurement model.
- [`relay-observability.md`](./relay-observability.md) explains the opt-in relay telemetry export privacy contract.

## Current status

| Surface | Current state | Leaves device? | Primary source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Structured tracing/logging | Code uses `tracing` macros with explicit `target` and `method` fields. The app/CLI does not install a global tracing subscriber in the current source, so host apps or tests decide whether these events are collected. | No, unless a host installs and exports a subscriber. | [`overview/observability.md`](./overview/observability.md), [`tracing_audit.rs`](../../crates/cgka-conformance-simulator/tests/tracing_audit.rs) |
| Device-local relay telemetry | Always collected by the shared Nostr relay plane while it runs: lifecycle counters, delivery-spread histograms, sync timing, and redacted relay health. | No. Exposed locally via `MarmotApp::relay_telemetry`, runtime `relay_plane().relay_telemetry()`, and `wn relay-stats`. | [`relay_plane.rs`](../../crates/marmot-app/src/relay_plane.rs), [`telemetry.rs`](../../crates/transport-nostr-adapter/src/telemetry.rs) |
| Device-local app performance telemetry | Always available inside `RuntimeSharedServices` while the runtime exists: aggregate duration histograms plus attempts/success/failure counters for startup, directory subscription sync, local account open, transport activation, subscription registration, sync/catch-up, host splash/foreground readiness, one-sided outbound message send, group invite/admin/read/accept operations, and media upload/download. Process-wide SQLCipher interrupted-migration probe run/skip counters (mdk#1439) are merged into the snapshot from `sqlcipher.rs`. Exposed locally via `MarmotAppRuntime::app_performance_snapshot()` and the MarmotKit `appPerformanceSnapshot()` binding. | No by itself. Local getters return the aggregate snapshot to the host process only. Included in the OTLP export batch only after the same opt-in export gate passes. | [`app_telemetry.rs`](../../crates/marmot-app/src/app_telemetry.rs), [`runtime.rs`](../../crates/marmot-app/src/runtime.rs) |
| Opt-in telemetry export | Implemented and off by default. Requires opt-in settings to be persisted, plus runtime endpoint, bearer token, and resource metadata. OTLP wire encoding and HTTP push are behind the `otlp-export` feature. Exports relay metrics and app-performance metrics in one batch. | Yes, only after the export gate passes. Relay metrics may carry only `relay`; account sync/catch-up failure counters carry only the closed `failure_stage` and `error_class` attributes. Other app-performance metrics are unlabeled population metrics. | [`relay_telemetry_export.rs`](../../crates/marmot-app/src/relay_telemetry_export.rs), [`config.rs`](../../crates/marmot-app/src/config.rs) |
| Agent connector reconciliation telemetry | Always collected while `wn-agent` runs: process-local cumulative counters for the shared inbound catch-up driver and the invite-policy worker (passes, outcomes, accounts/candidate rows considered), plus one privacy-safe `tracing` event per scheduled pass carrying a `source` label, duration, result, and aggregate counts (mdk#1380). | No. Counters are process-local; tracing events follow the no-ids/no-urls/no-content rules. | [`reconcile_telemetry.rs`](../../crates/agent-connector/src/reconcile_telemetry.rs), [`event_projection.rs`](../../crates/agent-connector/src/event_projection.rs), [`invite_policy.rs`](../../crates/agent-connector/src/invite_policy.rs) |
| Engine convergence/outbound telemetry | Implemented inside `cgka-engine` as aggregate post-settle reorg, convergence-pass, foreground deferred-peel, outbound-phase, and queued-intent counters/histograms. Exposed locally by `Engine::engine_metrics()`. The full `EngineMetricsSnapshot` is device-local only. The relay-plane/export structs accept only an optional `EngineReorgMetrics` projection, and the periodic runtime exporter passes `None`. | No via the runtime exporter today. | [`engine_metrics.rs`](../../crates/cgka-engine/src/engine_metrics.rs), [`relay_plane.rs`](../../crates/marmot-app/src/relay_plane.rs) |
| Product analytics / crash reporting | No product analytics or crash reporting SDK integration was found in the current source. Aptabase is mentioned only as future product-analytics context in a doc; it is not wired. | No. | Workspace search on 2026-06-10 |

## What is collected locally

### Adapter lifecycle counters

`NostrAdapterMetrics` is returned by `NostrTransportAdapter::metrics()` and included in
`RelayTelemetrySnapshot.metrics`.

| Field | Meaning | Sensitivity |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `active_accounts` | Number of account routes currently active in the shared adapter. | Aggregate count. |
| `active_group_subscriptions` | Number of group subscriptions currently active across accounts. | Aggregate count. |
| `subscriptions_created` | Cumulative subscriptions issued by activation/sync. | Aggregate count. |
| `subscriptions_removed` | Cumulative subscriptions removed by replacement, sync, or deactivation. | Aggregate count. |
| `inbound_events_seen` | Deduplicated relay events passed into the delivery path. | Aggregate count. |
| `inbound_events_delivered` | Account-scoped deliveries successfully enqueued. A single event may deliver to more than one account route. | Aggregate count. |
| `inbound_events_dropped` | Deduplicated relay events with no matching active route. | Aggregate count. |
| `publish_attempts` | Publish attempts through the adapter. | Aggregate count. |
| `publish_successes` | Publish calls where the relay client returned an outcome. | Aggregate count. |
| `publish_failures` | Publish calls where the relay client returned an error. | Aggregate count. |

These counters are diagnostic only. They must not feed convergence or branch selection.

### Cross-relay delivery spread

`RelayDeliveryTelemetry` records one local-time sighting per logical `MessageId` and per opaque relay index. Its
snapshot is `RelayDeliverySpread`, included as `RelayTelemetrySnapshot.delivery_spread`.

| Field | Meaning | Sensitivity |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `observed` | Distinct logical messages first observed within the tracking table. | Aggregate count. |
| `corroborated` | Messages seen from at least two distinct relays before pruning. | Aggregate count. |
| `single_source` | Messages pruned after being seen from exactly one relay. | Aggregate count. |
| `spread` | Histogram of local-time delta from first relay copy to each later distinct-relay copy. | Histogram buckets only. |
| `per_relay[].relay_index` | Opaque device-local relay index. | Local-only index; not a URL. |
| `per_relay[].delivered_first` | Times this relay index surfaced a copy first. | Per-relay local count by opaque index. |
| `per_relay[].delivered_later` | Times this relay index corroborated a message after another relay surfaced it first. | Per-relay local count by opaque index. |

Derived value: `RelayDeliveryStats::first_deliverer_rate()` returns
`delivered_first / (delivered_first + delivered_later)`.

Important details:

- The clock is the adapter's local monotonic clock, never Nostr `created_at`.
- The tracking table is pruned after `60_000ms`; messages that never get a second relay copy before pruning increment
  `single_source`.
- Re-delivery of the same message by the same relay is ignored for spread.
- A third relay copy adds another spread sample, but does not increment `corroborated` again.

### Subscription sync timing

`RelaySyncTelemetry` records subscription start, first event, and EOSE timing per subscription and opaque relay index.
Its snapshot is `RelaySyncSnapshot`, included as `RelayTelemetrySnapshot.sync`.

| Field | Meaning | Sensitivity |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tracked_subscriptions` | Number of subscriptions currently tracked for sync timing. | Aggregate count. |
| `synced_subscriptions` | Tracked subscriptions where every relay has reached EOSE. | Aggregate count. |
| `first_event` | Aggregate histogram of time from subscription start to first event. | Histogram buckets only. |
| `eose` | Aggregate histogram of time from subscription start to EOSE. | Histogram buckets only. |
| `per_relay[].relay_index` | Opaque device-local relay index. | Local-only index; not a URL. |
| `per_relay[].first_event` | Per-relay first-event latency histogram. | Histogram by opaque index. |
| `per_relay[].eose` | Per-relay EOSE latency histogram. | Histogram by opaque index. |

`NostrTransportAdapter::subscription_synced(subscription_id)` can answer whether every relay in a tracked subscription
has reached EOSE, but subscription ids are not included in telemetry snapshots.

### Duration histogram shape

Relay delivery-spread, first-event, and EOSE histograms use the same inclusive millisecond bucket bounds:

```text
1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 30, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 300, 500, 750,
1000, 1500, 2000, 3000, 5000, 7500, 10000, 15000, 20000, 30000
```

`DurationHistogramSnapshot` contains:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `buckets[].upper_bound_ms` | Inclusive bucket upper bound. |
| `buckets[].count` | Samples in that bucket. |
| `overflow_count` | Samples above `30000ms`. |
| `sum_ms` | Saturating sum of all observed durations in milliseconds. |

`approx_percentile_ms()` returns the upper bound of the bucket containing the requested percentile, `None` when there
are no samples, and `None` if the percentile falls in overflow.

### Relay-plane health

`RelayPlaneHealth` is included in `RelayTelemetrySnapshot.health`. When the relay plane is backed by `nostr-sdk`,
`NostrSdkRelayHealth` summarizes SDK relay status without relay URLs. The relay plane also adds directory-sync counters.

| Field | Meaning | Exported today? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sdk_backed` | Whether the relay plane is backed by `nostr-sdk`. | No. |
| `total_relays` | Number of relays known to the SDK client. | No. |
| `initialized`, `pending`, `connecting`, `connected`, `disconnected`, `terminated`, `banned`, `sleeping` | Counts of relays in each SDK status. | No. |
| `connection_attempts` | Sum of SDK relay connection attempts. | Yes, as `relay_connection_attempts`. |
| `connection_successes` | Sum of SDK relay connection successes. | Yes, as `relay_connection_successes`. |
| `directory_inflight_fetches` | Directory fetches currently in flight. | No. |
| `directory_active_subscriptions` | Active directory subscription ids. | No. |
| `directory_completed_fetches` | Completed directory fetches. | No. |
| `directory_coalesced_waiters` | Fetch waiters coalesced onto an existing request. | No. |
| `directory_failed_fetches` | Failed directory fetches. | No. |
| `directory_completed_subscription_syncs` | Completed directory subscription sync passes. | No. |
| `directory_subscriptions_created` | Directory subscriptions created. | No. |
| `directory_subscriptions_removed` | Directory subscriptions removed. | No. |

### Engine convergence and outbound metrics

`EngineMetrics` lives inside `cgka-engine` and is read through `Engine::engine_metrics()`. Its full
`EngineMetricsSnapshot` is device-local only and is not part of `RelayTelemetrySnapshot` or accepted by the exporter.
The relay-plane export rollup accepts only an optional `EngineReorgMetrics` projection, and the current periodic
exporter passes `None`, so no engine metrics are sent by the runtime exporter today.

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `settles` | Times a group reached `Settled` and applied a branch, summed across groups. |
| `post_settle_reorgs` | Settles later superseded by a branch that diverged below the previously applied tip. |
| `reorg_rewind_depth` | Histogram in commits: `previous_applied_tip - new_fork_epoch`. |
| `reorg_lateness_ms` | Histogram in milliseconds: local time from superseded settle to reorg. |
| `observed_reorg_rate()` | Derived `post_settle_reorgs / settles`, `None` with no settles. |
| `pass_apply_latency_ms` | Histogram from convergence-pass open to apply/completion. |
| `generation_gap_ms` | Histogram from one completed generation to the next generation opening. |
| `freeze_overdue_ms` | Histogram of scheduler lag past a convergence-pass cutoff. |
| `admin_reservation_*` | Aggregate observations and outcomes for the one-attempt queued admin reservation. |
| `outbound_required_convergence_ms` | Monotonic duration of required authenticated convergence during outbound preflight. |
| `outbound_deferred_peel_ms` | Monotonic duration of the foreground deferred-peel phase. |
| `outbound_queue_accept_ms` | Monotonic duration required to durably accept an outbound intent. |
| `outbound_wire_prepare_ms` | Monotonic duration of actual MLS/wire preparation; queued attempts add no sample. |
| `foreground_deferred_rows_attempted` | Histogram of deferred rows attempted per foreground opportunity. |
| `foreground_deferred_backlog` | Histogram of deferred backlog observed by foreground opportunities. |
| `foreground_deferred_completed`, `foreground_deferred_budget_exhausted`, `foreground_deferred_normalization_pending`, `foreground_deferred_unchanged`, `foreground_deferred_errors` | Aggregate foreground outcomes. |
| `foreground_deferred_budget_overrun_ms` | Histogram of elapsed foreground time beyond its configured monotonic budget; zero is recorded when work completes within budget. |
| `queued_outbound_wait_ms` | Histogram from durable intent acceptance to later regeneration attempt. |

`reorg_lateness_ms` uses the same millisecond bucket bounds as relay timing. `reorg_rewind_depth` uses commit-count
buckets:

```text
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 16, 32
```

Engine metrics keep an in-memory per-group last-applied branch record for classification, but snapshots contain only
aggregate counts and histograms. Deferred-peel and outbound metrics likewise contain no group, message, account,
member, relay, fingerprint, branch, or payload identifiers and never feed convergence or scheduling decisions.

### App performance telemetry

`AppPerformanceTelemetry` lives in `RuntimeSharedServices` and exposes an `AppPerformanceSnapshot`. Hosts read the
snapshot in-process through `MarmotAppRuntime::app_performance_snapshot()`; the MarmotKit
`appPerformanceSnapshot()` binding carries the same aggregate fields across UniFFI for debug surfaces and support
dumps. Neither path adds collection — both return the counters and histograms the runtime already keeps. Each
operation has the same shape:

| Field | Meaning | Sensitivity |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `attempts` | Cumulative operation attempts since process start. | Aggregate count. |
| `successes` | Cumulative successful operations since process start. | Aggregate count. |
| `failures` | Cumulative failed operations since process start. | Aggregate count. |
| `duration_ms` | Cumulative fixed-bucket duration histogram, measured with local monotonic time. | Histogram buckets only. |

Collected operations:

| Operation | Measurement envelope | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `app_start` | `MarmotAppRuntime::start()`, from method entry through directory-storage warmup, telemetry config construction, locally ready account reconciliation, and running-state mark. | Relay connection, subscription registration, directory sync, and catch-up continue asynchronously after `start()` returns. |
| `directory_subscription_sync` | One directory worker `request_rebuild_and_wait()` pass. | Initial startup schedules this pass asynchronously, so slow directory relays do not hold the splash screen. |
| `account_reconcile` | `AccountManager::reconcile()`, including local-signing account enumeration, stale-worker stop, pending-worker spawn, and ready wait. | Recorded every time reconcile runs, including implicit reconcile before catch-up. |
| `account_open` | One sample per newly spawned account worker, from worker spawn until the ready signal. | Covers the seeded SQLCipher/session open, local engine-group reconciliation, and local projection backfill. Full group hydration and the read-snapshot capture run after the ready signal (mdk#1161) and are measured separately below. It does not include relay work. |
| `account_session_open` | `AccountDeviceSession::open` inside the worker's account open: SQLCipher storage open, engine construction (including key-package retirement), and the cheap group seed pass. | Stage attribution for `account_open`; recorded from `SessionOpenTimings` after a successful open, so it has no failure samples. |
| `account_group_hydration` | Two samples per runtime account open (mdk#1161): the cheap seed pass inside `AccountDeviceSession::open` (subset of `account_session_open`), and the worker's background hydration pipeline from readiness until every group is fully hydrated. | The pipeline sample is the stage that scales with stored group state; the seed sample stays flat. |
| `account_profile_load` | The one shared account-profile load at the start of the startup group-read-snapshot capture. | Single storage read reused across every group in the snapshot. |
| `account_group_read_snapshot` | The full startup `GroupReadSnapshot` capture after the ready signal. | Scales with groups × members; snapshot answers worker read commands during initial catch-up. |
| `account_transport_activation` | Initial account signer installation and inbox transport activation after local readiness. | Runs asynchronously after the worker ready signal; includes no caller-supplied relay label. |
| `account_subscription_registration` | Initial registration of the hydrated account's group subscriptions. | Runs after transport activation and before relay catch-up; a slow registration cannot delay local readiness. |
| `account_catch_up` | `AccountManager::catch_up_accounts()`, including its reconcile step, catch-up command fanout, and waiting for every worker response. | Multi-account aggregate. |
| `account_sync` | The initial asynchronous account network/bootstrap phase and each later account-worker `client.sync()` catch-up. | The startup sample includes transport preparation, relay data drain, processing, projection/state update, and relay-dependent open maintenance; later samples cover catch-up only. |
| `account_setup_identity_local` | Generated identity/keychain creation plus durable local account record initialization. | Ends before relay work. |
| `account_setup_storage_local` | SQLCipher account-storage creation/open for the generated identity. | Separates database initialization from KeyPackage generation and signing. |
| `account_setup_profile_local` | Exact default-profile selection and durable local directory projection. | The returned binding profile is this local value. |
| `account_bootstrap_relay_and_follow_publish` / `account_default_profile_publish` | Generated bootstrap relay/follow records and the default profile publication. | Background, retryable, independently timed, and excluded from local-ready caller latency. |
| `account_setup_key_package_local` | Initial KeyPackage generation, private-material persistence, signing, and exact signed-revision persistence. | Completes before local-ready handoff and before any setup publication. |
| `account_initial_key_package_publish` | Initial KeyPackage relay publication and durable confirmation. | Background and retryable from the persisted revision; bounded-age transports may first persist a newer signed revision at the same replaceable coordinate. |
| `account_setup_local_ready_handoff` | Complete generated-account caller latency through local worker readiness. | The host may render local state but must not claim invite readiness. |
| `account_setup_network_ready` | Background work from local-ready scheduling through bootstrap and KeyPackage confirmation plus journal completion. | Success is the invite-receivable boundary. |
| `outbound_message_send` | Worker `SendMessage` and `SendAppEvent` commands until their send call returns a `SendSummary` or error. | One-sided local send/publish confirmation only. It is not end-to-end remote delivery or read latency. |
| `group_create_key_package_lookup` | Total create-time member KeyPackage lookup from canonicalization through validated result collection. | Preserved aggregate dimension; includes either cache-only reuse or create-time relay resolution below. |
| `group_member_key_package_prewarm` | Host/runtime composition prewarm for the current member set. | Aggregate duration only. No member count label, account/relay identity, reservation, or package consumption. |
| `group_create_key_package_cache_reuse` | Successful create-time lookup when every canonical member was satisfied by revalidated local/directory state. | Closed operation name, not a caller-supplied label. A prewarm should shift the later Create wait into this bucket. |
| `group_create_key_package_network_resolution` | Successful create-time lookup that required relay-list or KeyPackage network work for at least one canonical member. | Closed operation name, not a member-count or relay label. |
| `group_create_queue_wait` | Time from enqueueing `CreateGroup` until the account worker begins it. | Separates worker contention from create work. |
| `group_create_image_preprocess` | Prepared founding-image validation, dimension inspection, encryption, and SQLCipher staging. | Contains no network time. Rejections occur before encryption and upload. |
| `group_create_image_upload` | Optional initial image selection/upload. | Recorded only when an initial image was supplied. |
| `group_create_mls_prepare_persist` | Engine create through the authoritative atomic MLS group plus retained founding-Welcome commit. | The canonical point of no return. |
| `group_create_pending_welcome_index` | In-memory derivation of founding Welcome message ids needed by the post-response fanout driver. | The durable app repair index is convenience-only and is not committed on this path; failures and reconciliation populate it later. |
| `group_create_local_projection_save` | The single app SQLCipher transaction that writes the account-group projection and materializes its chat-list row. | The returned row is the row committed by this transaction, not a follow-up read. |
| `group_create_response_handoff` | Worker publication of the `NewGroup` projection event plus the command-response send. | Covers the row-bearing response boundary; UniFFI performs only mechanical DTO conversion afterward. |
| `group_create_welcome_publish` | Founding Welcome publication driven after the managed worker response. | Not part of caller latency; preserves mdk#1451. |
| `group_create_subscription_refresh` | Post-response runtime group-subscription refresh. | Failures are repairable by the next sync cycle. |
| `group_create_post_mutation_catch_up` | Detached account catch-up scheduled after the create command response. | Also contributes to aggregate account catch-up telemetry. |
| `group_create_total_caller_latency` | Public runtime create entry through the row-bearing worker response. | Includes queue wait, lookup, canonical MLS persistence, derived-index preparation, app projection persistence, and response handoff; excludes Welcome fanout and detached catch-up. |
| `group_invite_members` | `AccountManager::invite_members()`, from command dispatch through worker response, post-mutation catch-up, and audit-tracker scheduling. | Measures the public runtime invite envelope after any UniFFI admin preflight. |
| `group_invite_key_package_lookup` | Invite path KeyPackage resolution for every requested member before routing refresh. | Captures local cached lookups plus relay directory fetches used to obtain invitee KeyPackages. |
| `group_invite_routing_refresh` | Invite path `AppClient::refresh_routing()` after KeyPackage lookup and before pre-send runtime sync. | Captures local route/projection refresh work that affects publish targets. |
| `group_invite_pre_send_sync` | Invite path `AppClient::sync_runtime_groups()` immediately before engine send. | Separates pre-send relay/runtime sync from MLS commit and publish. |
| `group_invite_engine_publish` | Invite path `AccountDeviceRuntime::send_with_audit_context()` plus publish-failure check. | Covers MLS Add/Commit staging, commit publish, local publish confirmation, and Welcome publish. |
| `group_invite_local_refresh` | Invite path local audit success, publish report cache, group refresh, retention pruning, state save, and projection queueing after publish. | Identifies local projection/storage work after the engine publish stage returns. |
| `group_invite_notification_trigger` | Invite path best-effort notification-trigger publish. | The helper logs failures internally; the timing sample records the duration of the best-effort call. |
| `group_invite_post_mutation_catch_up` | The `catch_up_accounts()` call run after `InviteMembers` returns from the account worker. | Also contributes to the aggregate `account_catch_up` metric; this operation scopes that same wait to invite flows. |
| `group_promote_admin` | `AccountManager::promote_admin()`, from command dispatch through worker response, post-mutation catch-up, and audit-tracker scheduling. | Covers the separate admin-policy mutation path used when invite-as-admin follows member invite. |
| `group_details_read` | UniFFI `group_details_for()`, including account/group lookup, member read, display-name hydration, and DTO assembly. | Matches the FFI `groupDetails` surface consumed by apps. |
| `group_conversation_snapshot_read` | UniFFI `group_conversation_snapshot_for()`, including one session-consistent worker read, display-name hydration, and both DTO projections. | Matches the combined conversation-loading surface; aggregate duration/counters only, with no group or account labels. |
| `group_mls_state_read` | `AccountManager::group_mls_state()`, from worker command dispatch through the read response. | Captures projection reads used by the conversation developer/debug state surface. |
| `group_accept_invite` | `AccountManager::accept_group_invite()`, from worker command dispatch through the worker response. | Caller-visible accept latency; a worker-busy rejection counts as a failed attempt, matching the `group_create_total_caller_latency` convention. The join itself is published by the invite catch-up flow, not by this envelope. |
| `media_upload` | Worker `UploadMedia` command until `client.upload_media()` returns. | Measures local encryption/upload pipeline and endpoint response time as seen by this device. |
| `media_download` | Worker `DownloadMedia` command until `client.download_media()` returns. | Measures local fetch/decrypt pipeline and endpoint response time as seen by this device. |
| `host_splash_ready` | Host-defined launch origin until the primary UI is allowed to leave its splash/loading screen. | Recorded by the host through `record_host_performance`; use success only when the usable local UI is actually presented. |
| `host_foreground_local_ready` | Foreground activation until locally persisted content is usable. | Excludes relay catch-up; remote refresh continues asynchronously. |

App-performance histograms use wider inclusive millisecond bucket bounds than relay timing so startup and media transfer
latencies do not immediately fall into overflow:

```text
1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 30, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 300, 500, 750,
1000, 1500, 2000, 3000, 5000, 7500, 10000, 15000, 20000, 30000,
60000, 120000, 300000
```

These app-performance samples deliberately do not include account labels, account ids, group ids, member refs, message
ids, relay URLs, media URLs, payload sizes, content types, upload endpoints, download endpoints, or error strings.
Host applications can only select the closed `HostPerformanceOperation` enum; callers cannot supply metric names,
label names, or label values. Adding a new cross-platform operation requires an MDK API change and review.

The `app_account_sync_failures` and `app_account_catch_up_failures` counters are the only app-performance metrics with
metric attributes. Every failed attempt emits exactly one point in a bounded classification bucket:

| Attribute | Allowed values |
| --- | --- |
| `failure_stage` | `transport_activation`, `group_subscription_sync`, `relay_receive`, `cgka_ingest`, `state_persist`, `account_worker`, `unknown` |
| `error_class` | `timeout`, `transport_closed`, `relay_directory`, `protocol`, `crypto`, `storage`, `cancelled`, `unknown` |

`failure_stage` is the explicit sync boundary that stopped; `error_class` is derived from typed error variants. A
catch-up failure propagated to its parent account sync retains the same pair. The implementation never parses
`Display` or debug text. If a typed cause is unavailable, it uses `unknown`; it does not infer a class from backend
strings. Raw errors, relay URLs, account/group/event ids, pubkeys, file paths, and caller-generated strings cannot enter
these fields because the snapshot and export types store closed enums rather than strings.

Transport `Backend`, `Subscription`, and `Publish` errors intentionally use `error_class=unknown`: their current typed
variants carry backend text but do not expose a safe, more specific cause. Their explicit `failure_stage` remains the
useful diagnostic dimension until those lower layers preserve additional typed source information.

### Agent connector reconciliation telemetry

`ReconcileTelemetry` (in `crates/agent-connector/src/reconcile_telemetry.rs`) holds process-local cumulative
counters for the two background reconciliation loops in `wn-agent` (mdk#1380): the shared inbound catch-up driver
(`source = "inbound_catch_up"`) and the welcomer-allowlist invite-policy worker (`source = "invite_policy"`). Both
loops schedule event- or retry-driven work with an adaptive safety net, so the counters exist to prove idle passes
stay rare and cheap.

| Counter | Meaning | Sensitivity |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `catch_up_passes_started/completed/failed` | Scheduled safety-net catch-up passes and their outcomes. | Aggregate counts. |
| `catch_up_passes_with_activity` | Completed passes that observed qualifying runtime activity (these hold the net at its base interval). | Aggregate count. |
| `catch_up_accounts_considered` | Sum of running account workers fanned out across completed passes. | Aggregate count. |
| `catch_up_explicit_requests` | Out-of-band catch-ups (e.g. a `SubscribeInbound` initial catch-up), which never perturb the adaptive schedule. | Aggregate count. |
| `invite_enumerations_started/completed/failed` | Pending-invite safety enumerations and their outcomes. | Aggregate counts. |
| `invite_accounts_considered` | Sum of local-signing accounts enumerated across passes. | Aggregate count. |
| `invite_candidate_rows_considered` | Sum of pending-invite projection rows read across enumerations. Zero on an idle session regardless of retained history size; this is the database-read amplification gauge. | Aggregate count. |
| `invite_policy_applied` / `invite_policy_apply_failures` | Policy decisions applied vs. retry-pending failures. | Aggregate counts. |

Each scheduled pass also emits one `tracing` event (debug on success, warn on failure) with explicit
`target`/`method`, a `source` label, `duration_ms`, a coarse `result`, and aggregate counts only — no account
ids, group ids, message ids, relay URLs, or content.

## How local relay telemetry is recorded

The Nostr relay plane intentionally splits delivery from telemetry:

| Tap | Source notification | What it does | What it avoids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Delivery tap | `RelayPoolNotification::Event` | Converts the deduplicated Nostr event into a `TransportMessage`, routes it to matching account/group queues, and increments inbound lifecycle counters. | It does not record delivery spread or first-event timing because this SDK path only sees the first copy across the pool. |
| Telemetry tap | Raw `RelayPoolNotification::Message::Event` | Observes every relay copy, assigns/uses an opaque `RelayIndex`, records cross-relay spread, and records first-event latency for the subscription. | It performs no delivery. |
| EOSE tap | Raw `RelayPoolNotification::Message::EndOfStoredEvents` | Records per-relay EOSE latency and advances the initial-sync gate. | It performs no delivery. |

The opaque `RelayIndex` to relay URL map is held in `RelayIndexRegistry`. A reverse lookup is available only through
`resolve_relay_labels(RelayExportConsent)`, and the relay plane only mints that consent after export is opted in and the
export config passes validation.

## Local inspection surfaces

`wn relay-stats` prints the current process/runtime's `RelayTelemetrySnapshot` as human text. `wn relay-stats --json`
serializes the full snapshot shape. The plain text intentionally says:

```text
relay telemetry (device-local, aggregate, no relay URLs)
```

The command shows:

- adapter lifecycle counters;
- delivery spread observed/corroborated/single-source counts;
- delivery spread p50 and p99 derived from histogram buckets;
- subscription sync p50 first-event and EOSE latency;
- one per-relay row per opaque relay index, never a relay URL;
- redacted relay health counts.

## Persisted settings and runtime configuration

Relay telemetry export settings are stored in shared SQLite, one row per app root:

| Table | Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `relay_telemetry_settings` | `export_enabled` | Persisted opt-in switch. Default `false`. |
| `relay_telemetry_settings` | `export_interval_seconds` | Persisted poll/push interval. Default `60`. Must be from `10` through `3600` seconds. |
| `relay_telemetry_settings` | `updated_at_ms` | Local wall-clock update time in milliseconds. |
| `telemetry_install` | `install_id` | Stable random UUID-like install id generated per app root. Host apps can use it as OTLP `service.instance.id`. |
| `telemetry_install` | `updated_at_ms` | Local wall-clock update time in milliseconds. |

The OTLP endpoint itself is not persisted in the current schema. If a legacy `otlp_endpoint` column exists,
`SqliteSharedStorage::clear_legacy_relay_telemetry_endpoint()` clears it.

Runtime-only config is supplied by the host app:

| Field | Meaning | Persisted by Marmot? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `RelayTelemetryRuntimeConfig.otlp_endpoint` | Optional full OTLP/HTTP metrics URL override. If absent, the app can use the compiled/default endpoint. | No. |
| `authorization_bearer_token` | Bearer token from host/platform secret storage. | No. |
| `resource` | OTLP resource attributes from the platform shell. | No. |

Compiled/default endpoints come from `MarmotServiceEndpoints`, which reads `MARMOT_RELAY_TELEMETRY_OTLP_ENDPOINT` at
compile time if present.

The UniFFI bridge exposes:

- `relay_telemetry_settings()`;
- `set_relay_telemetry_settings(...)`;
- `telemetry_install_id()`;
- `set_relay_telemetry_runtime_config(...)`.

## Export gate

`RelayTelemetryExportConfig::export_allowed()` must be true before the exporter can be constructed or relay labels can
be resolved. The gate requires all the following:

- `enabled == true`;
- an endpoint is configured;
- the endpoint is `https`, or `http` to a loopback host (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, or `::1`) for local testing;
- `authorization_bearer_token` is present and non-empty;
- `resource` is present and has all required attributes.

If export is enabled but the URL/auth/resource gate is incomplete, construction fails closed and logs a warning without
resolving relay identities or pushing metrics. If `marmot-app` is built without `otlp-export`, runtime configuration
logs a warning when export is requested, but no exporter task is started.

Runtime behavior:

- `MarmotAppRuntime::start()` reads persisted settings, combines them with runtime config and service endpoints, then
  configures the exporter after directory sync and account reconciliation.
- The runtime exporter snapshots `AppPerformanceTelemetry` on every push and appends those population-level points to
  the relay batch. Engine reorg metrics are still passed as `None` by the periodic loop.
- Changing settings while the runtime is running restarts the exporter with the new config.
- Changing runtime config while the runtime is running restarts the exporter with the current persisted settings.
- Runtime shutdown aborts the exporter task.

## What leaves the device in opt-in telemetry export

The export batch is `RelayTelemetryExportBatch`, a flat list of `ExportMetricPoint`s. Despite the historical type name,
the batch now carries both relay metrics and app-performance metrics. Each point has:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `name` | Static metric name from `metric_names`. |
| `relay` | Optional relay URL label, used only by relay metrics. |
| `failure` | Optional closed sync/catch-up classification, encoded as `failure_stage` and `error_class`; used only by the two account failure counters. |
| `value` | `Counter(u64)`, `Gauge(f64)`, or `Histogram(ExportHistogram)`. |

`ExportHistogram` carries:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `bounds_ms` | Millisecond bucket upper bounds copied from local snapshots. |
| `bucket_counts` | Count per bucket. |
| `overflow_count` | Samples above the largest bound. |
| `sum_ms` | Saturating sum of all observed durations in milliseconds. |

Per-relay points are emitted only when an opaque relay index resolves to a relay URL at the opt-in export boundary.
Unresolved relay indices are skipped rather than exported as opaque ids.

Current implementation note: publish telemetry is device-wide attempts/successes/failures. It is not currently
per-relay or per-Nostr-kind, even though the relay observability design doc names those as desired future ranking
signals.

### OTLP encoding

When the `otlp-export` feature is enabled:

- counters encode as monotonic cumulative OTLP sums;
- gauges encode as OTLP gauges;
- histograms encode as cumulative OTLP histograms with the same explicit bounds and duration sum as local snapshots,
  plus an overflow bucket;
- metric unit is `ms` for histograms and `1` for counters/gauges;
- instrumentation scope name is `marmot.relay_telemetry`;
- HTTP body content type is `application/x-protobuf`;
- the request is sent with bearer auth to the configured full OTLP metrics URL.

Resource attributes on every OTLP request:

| Attribute | Source |
| --- | --- |
| `service.name` | Constant `mdk`. |
| `service.namespace` | Constant `marmot`. |
| `service.version` | `RelayTelemetryResource.service_version`. |
| `service.instance.id` | `RelayTelemetryResource.service_instance_id`, typically the app-root `telemetry_install_id()`. |
| `deployment.environment.name` | `RelayTelemetryResource.deployment_environment`. |
| `tenant` | `RelayTelemetryResource.tenant`. |
| `os.type` | `RelayTelemetryResource.os_type`. |
| `os.version` | `RelayTelemetryResource.os_version`. |
| `device.model.identifier` | Optional `RelayTelemetryResource.device_model_identifier`. |

Example PromQL (for collectors that expose OTLP monotonic sums with the conventional `_total` suffix):

```promql
sum by (failure_stage, error_class, service_version) (
  increase(app_account_catch_up_failures_total[24h])
)
```

Exporter timing:

- first push happens immediately when `run()` starts, unless shutdown was already requested;
- later pushes happen on the configured interval with jitter up to half the interval, capped at `10s`;
- `export_once_with_retries()` performs the initial attempt plus up to three retries within one export window;
- retry base delay is one-tenth of the interval, clamped from `50ms` through `1000ms`, then exponentially backed off;
- HTTP connect timeout is `10s`, request timeout is `30s`;
- failures are logged with a privacy-safe warning and are not persisted to disk or queued for later.

## Tracing and logging

The repo has the `tracing` and `tracing-subscriber` dependencies, but the current `wn`, `wnd`, `wn-agent`, and
`marmot-app` runtime source does not install a global tracing subscriber. As a result, these `tracing::*` calls are
instrumentation points. They are collected only if a host application, test harness, or future binary initializes a
subscriber.

The guardrail test `production_tracing_calls_are_structured_and_privacy_safe` scans production Rust source under
`crates/` and enforces:

- every tracing call has an explicit `target:`;
- every tracing call has a `method =` field;
- tracing macro bodies must not contain known-sensitive token names:
  `account_id`, `member_id`, `group_id`, `message_id`, `transport_group_id`, `relay_url`, `pubkey`, `event_id`,
  `subscription_id`, `payload`, `content`, `plaintext`, `ciphertext`, `key_material`, `private_key`, `mls_bytes`.

The guardrail test `production_library_sources_do_not_write_direct_output` rejects `println!`, `eprintln!`, and `dbg!`
from production library source. CLI binaries may write explicit command output to stdout/stderr.

Notable tracing targets currently present:

| Target | Typical methods / fields |
| --- | --- |
| `transport_nostr_adapter::adapter` | `metrics`, `delivery_spread`, `relay_sync`, `handle_relay_event`, `activate_account`, `sync_account_groups`, `deactivate_account`, `publish`; fields are counts such as `delivered`, endpoint counts, subscription counts, required ack count. |
| `marmot_app::relay_plane` | Relay notification forwarding, directory subscription/fetch lifecycle, router shutdown/drop warnings; fields are status/counts and bounded error categories. |
| `marmot_app::relay_telemetry_export` | Exporter construction, `export_once`, `run`; fields include `point_count` and safe warning categories. |
| `marmot_app::audit_log` | Audit tracker scheduling/upload summaries; fields include `trigger`, `skipped_reason`, uploaded/failed counts, and file index. Audit content is not logged. |
| `marmot_app::runtime` | Startup/shutdown and worker lifecycle; fields include elapsed times and active operation counts. |
| `cgka_session::session` | Session lifecycle method markers such as open, send, ingest, publish confirmation, and catch-up. |
| `cgka_engine::engine_metrics` | Snapshotting engine metrics. |
| `cgka_engine::snapshot_guard` | Snapshot retention/cleanup warnings with safe counts/status only. |
| `marmot_account::*` and `marmot_app::*` | Account/app lifecycle warnings and projection/cache method markers. |
| `agent_connector::*` | Connector warning paths with safe error categories. |

Direct CLI output:

- `wn` and `wnd` write command outputs produced by `wn_cli` to stdout/stderr and print only a safe write-output
  failure message if writing fails.
- `wn-agent` prints startup failures with safe error codes/details from argument parsing and token-file setup. Its
  `ConnectorError` display path is reduced through `privacy_safe_code()` for startup failure output.

## What is deliberately not collected in telemetry/tracing

Outside the separate forensic audit-log mode documented in [`audit-logging.md`](./audit-logging.md), telemetry and
tracing must not collect:

- account ids, member ids, group ids, message ids, transport group ids, subscription ids, event ids, or pubkeys;
- relay URLs, except as the single opt-in relay metric label in the export channel;
- plaintext, ciphertext, MLS bytes, Nostr event content, payloads, key material, private keys, SQLCipher keys, or
  database paths;
- per-event or per-message telemetry rows in the export channel;
- end-to-end message latency across devices; the current send metric stops at this device's local send/publish result;
- media endpoint URLs, media object ids, media payload sizes, content types, or transfer error strings;
- source IP fields in the export batch.

## Verification commands

Focused checks for this surface:

```sh
cargo test -p transport-nostr-adapter
cargo test -p marmot-app
cargo test -p marmot-app --features otlp-export
cargo nextest run -p cgka-conformance-simulator --test tracing_audit
```

The repo-level `just check` and `just test` recipes include the `otlp-export` feature set through the shared
`otlp-features` variable.
