# Current State — Implementations & Spec

Where Marmot is today: the merged MIPs define the deployed protocol shape, this workspace is MDK at `0.9.0` (the
unifying bump above the previous `0.8.0` release), Marmot-TS gives us an independent TypeScript implementation, and the
CGKA engine/convergence workspace here is being shaped into spec text.

## The spec

**Merged MIPs:**

- **MIP-00** — Credentials & KeyPackages
- **MIP-01** — Group Construction
- **MIP-02** — Welcomes
- **MIP-03** — Group Messages and SelfRemove
- **Encrypted Media V2** — `marmot.group.encrypted-media.v2`, with frozen V1 support for already-joined legacy groups
- **MIP-05** — Push Notifications

**Implemented engine contracts:**

- **Distributed convergence** — deterministic branch selection for unordered transport input, including the durable
  frozen-pass boundary, in [`../distributed-convergence.md`](../distributed-convergence.md)

**In PR / design:**

- **MIP-06** — Multi-Device Support
- **Marmot v2 protocol draft** — protocol principles, publish lifecycle, and MLS app components in
  [marmot-protocol/marmot](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/marmot)
- **CGKA engine canonicalization** — post-peeling commit/proposal/app-message contract in
  [`../cgka-engine-canonicalization-contract.md`](../cgka-engine-canonicalization-contract.md)

The current spec pressure point is commit ordering. MLS wants one ordered commit log; Nostr and other transports may
deliver unordered, duplicated, delayed input. The engine contract is where that mismatch gets resolved.

MDK now persists a per-group frozen convergence pass around that selector. The pass closes at the earlier of the pinned
one-second selection-relevant quiescence window and five-second absolute cap, resumes safely across restart, resolves
only its digest-bound membership set, and uses independent runtime deadlines so traffic in one group cannot postpone
another group.

## Protocol implementations

### MDK (this repository)

This workspace is the Marmot Development Kit (MDK). Release `0.9.0` unifies every workspace crate under one version
cohort above the previous `0.8.0` MDK layout (`mdk-core`, `mdk-sqlite-storage`, and related crates). The current
crate tree under `crates/` is the production-shaped replacement: OpenMLS-backed engine, SQLCipher storage, Nostr
transports, multi-account app runtime, CLI/daemon/TUI, agent connector stack, UniFFI bindings, and conformance tooling.
The app runtime exposes an explicit prepared founding-image path: image validation/encryption and durable staging,
idempotent Blossom upload, and canonical group creation are separate host-visible operations. The final create uses
uploaded founding metadata and performs no media transfer; the older all-in-one founding-image API keeps its existing
uploaded-before-success semantics while also enforcing the new group-image byte, dimension, pixel, and format limits
before canonical creation.

Hosts can also send app-defined custom events: any non-reserved application event kind with verbatim tags and content,
through `marmot-app`, the MarmotKit bindings, or `wn messages send-event`. Stored events are queryable by kind on
every message surface, and custom kinds materialize as standalone timeline rows under a dedicated `CustomEvent`
update trigger. Kinds MDK owns (chat, reactions, edits, deletes, agent, group system, push token) are rejected on
the custom send path, so apps cannot forge protocol events.

The Codex, OpenCode, and Pi terminal harnesses share typed `inherit`,
`autonomous`, and `unrestricted` execution intent while retaining
backend-specific approval and sandbox semantics. Unrestricted installs require
explicit acknowledgement and an external OS-user, container, or VM boundary;
see [`terminal-harness-execution-profiles.md`](./terminal-harness-execution-profiles.md).

### Marmot-TS (TypeScript)

Marmot-TS is an independent implementation. It is valuable because it catches spec ambiguity that a single reference
implementation would normalize.

## Client reference implementation

### whitenoise-rs + whitenoise

whitenoise-rs is the application core for the Flutter client. It owns account management, relay control, event
processing, chat projection, push notifications, and other app-layer work that should stay above the CGKA engine
boundary.

Known architecture pressure remains in the application layer: large database surface, relay-control migration, and
event-processing complexity. Those are separate from the CGKA engine convergence work.

## Current CGKA engine workspace

This repository now has the main engine candidate:

- `crates/fs-private` — restrictive-by-construction helpers for local files, directories, and Unix sockets.
- `crates/traits` — cross-boundary value types and traits, including the account-aware `TransportAdapter` boundary.
- `crates/cgka-engine` — OpenMLS-backed engine implementation.
- `crates/cgka-session` — production-shaped account-device session wrapper over `Engine<SqliteAccountStorage>`.
- `crates/marmot-account` — account/session orchestration over a session and transport adapter. It activates the transport
  account, uses static transport routing for early harnesses, publishes fresh KeyPackages through an injected boundary,
  and confirms or rolls back pending session work from adapter publish reports.
- `crates/marmot-app` — first multi-account app runtime over account home, per-account projections, shared
  relay/directory cache, relay-list setup, KeyPackage lookup, runtime subscriptions, and app-facing
  group/message/member methods. Detailed group creation returns the exact chat-list row committed with the local
  projection; founding Welcome fanout stays post-response and its app repair index is reconstructed from
  engine-authoritative retained obligations.
- `crates/cli` — first real CLI, daemon, and TUI surface over `marmot-app`. It is intentionally product-facing rather
  than a lab harness, and its JSON envelope is shaped for daemon/TUI/testing callers.
- `crates/storage-sqlite` — SQLCipher-backed SQLite storage for Marmot and custom OpenMLS state, with Rust migrations
  for schema/data evolution. Tests and the simulator use its in-memory SQLite mode by default.
- `crates/transport-nostr-adapter` — Nostr transport adapter core for account activation, group subscription sync,
  relay-event routing, and endpoint-level publish reports behind an injectable relay-client boundary. It also has the
  first Marmot kind `30443` KeyPackage event builder/publisher boundary, with MIP-00 metadata supplied explicitly. Its
  optional `sdk` feature provides the first `nostr-sdk` backed relay client.
- `crates/transport-nostr-peeler` — Nostr boundary mapping for kind `445` / `1059` events, kind `445` group envelope
  peeling, and NIP-59 welcome wrap/peel with injected local signer/decrypter.
- `crates/transport-quic-stream` — raw QUIC transport binding for transient agent text stream previews over reliable
  ordered QUIC streams, with transcript hashes tied to durable MLS start/final app-message payloads. Encrypted
  publishers reserve the next sequence and transcript in the per-account SQLCipher database before writing records;
  ambiguous crash state disables that start's live preview rather than risking nonce reuse.
- `crates/transport-quic-broker` — memory-only QUIC pub/sub broker for forwarding live preview records by
  `stream_id + start_event_id` without account state, relay integration, or payload persistence.
- `crates/cgka-conformance-simulator` — multi-client simulator, vectors, generated scenarios, and property tests.
- `crates/marmot-markdown` — CommonMark and Nostr-aware display parser for app message rendering.
- `crates/marmot-forensics` — opt-in JSONL forensic audit schema and recorder traits.
- `crates/marmot-uniffi` — UniFFI bindings and build scripts for Swift/Kotlin app runtimes.
- `crates/agent-control` — `marmot.agent-control.v2` DTOs and newline-delimited JSON framing for agent integrations.
- `crates/agent-stream-compose` — reusable live-preview stream composition over the QUIC broker publisher.
- `crates/agent-connector` — local `wn-agent` connector daemon bridging agent control, account runtime, and stream
  composition; Hermes and OpenClaw plugins talk to it over a Unix socket. Version 2 stream sessions use random
  per-stream bearer capabilities, reject active stream-id collisions, and replay the original begin receipt for an
  identical request-id retry.
- `integrations/hermes/marmot` and `integrations/openclaw/marmot` — thin control-plane-only agent plugins.
- `formal/tamarin` — formal models for the convergence selector, delivery-order robustness, lifecycle cases, and
  proof/test mapping.
- [marmot-protocol/marmot](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/marmot) — canonical Marmot v2 protocol draft by stable
  surface, including protocol principles and app components (external to this repo).

The current workspace can exercise the peeler-ingest boundary through in-memory clients, reopen encrypted
SQLCipher-backed account-device sessions, preserve MLS signing identity across those reopens, drive a real
`AccountDeviceSession` + `NostrTransportAdapter` + `NostrMlsPeeler` stack over an in-memory relay client, cover publish
ack/fail resolution and delivery/invite-lifecycle chaos cases at that stack boundary, exercise a transport-generic
account runtime for activation, KeyPackage publication, and publish confirmation/rollback, converge stored OpenMLS
messages, emit application-visible group events, model losing-branch invalidations, and test generated delivery
variants.

Generated-account creation now has an explicit durable local-ready entry point. The identity, default profile, setup
journal, stable KeyPackage slot, private KeyPackage material, and exact signed initial publication revision are
persisted before that entry point returns. Bootstrap/profile/KeyPackage publication then continues as
restart-resumable background work. A transport with a bounded event-timestamp window may durably re-author that same
replaceable KeyPackage coordinate before retrying a stale revision; the private KeyPackage and stable slot do not
change, and the newer signed revision is persisted before network exposure. Possible exposure is journaled before
network I/O, and superseded exact event ids retain bounded per-relay deletion obligations until a kind-5 acknowledgement
or an exact recognized relay target-absence response clears each endpoint. Live endpoints are cleaned only after acknowledging a strictly
newer revision; expiry, consumption, and policy removal make cleanup immediately eligible. The compatibility `create_identity` entry
point still waits for `NetworkReady`. Hosts using the local-ready entry point
must honor `AccountSetupReadiness`: `LocalReady` is sufficient for local reads and profile rendering, while only
`NetworkReady` means the account may be presented as invite-receivable. `Initializing` means local setup has not yet
reached durable local readiness. `Publishing` includes bounded in-session retry and restart-resumable publication, and
`RecoveryRequired` requires an explicit recovery flow.

Destructive removal of a locally signing account persists an immutable private tombstone for its stable KeyPackage slot
before deleting the account home. Directory reads, cache writes, relay ingestion, and final publication all reject a
tombstoned slot; shared and per-account projections are scrubbed immediately and reconciled again during warmup after a
crash. Re-importing the identity creates a new stable slot, while legacy account state that cannot prove its old slot is
covered by a fail-closed account-wide marker that admits only a different slot proven by the active local signing
lifecycle.

## Known gaps

- **Production persistence hardening** — `storage-sqlite` provides encrypted persistence, atomic group snapshots,
  retained-anchor pruning, and privacy-oriented SQLite defaults. `cgka-session` opens one encrypted database per
  account-device identity. App key-management integration, packaging, and longer-term rekey/vacuum/checkpoint policy
  still need production wiring.
- **App-core hardening** — `marmot-app` and `wn` now exercise real account setup, key storage, relay-list repair,
  KeyPackage publication/fetch, directory cache, group membership, group profile projection, message projection, local
  archive state, and sync. Group composition now resolves canonical deduplicated member sets through bounded
  multi-author relay batches, with a non-reserving process-local prewarm path and final mutation-boundary revalidation.
  The next hardening pass should keep app policy in `marmot-app`/`marmot-account` and keep
  `wn` focused on command presentation and stable JSON output. The current boundary is summarized in
  [`app-core-boundary.md`](./app-core-boundary.md).
- **Production transport adapters** — `transport-nostr-adapter` now implements the Nostr adapter core over an injectable
  relay-client boundary, with an optional `nostr-sdk` relay client, exact stale group subscription cleanup,
  adapter-local metrics, privacy-safe tracing, and redacted SDK relay-health summaries. The SDK owns reconnect/backoff,
  retry interval adjustment, jitter, and relay status mechanics. The session crate now has an in-memory relay
  integration harness that drives NIP-59 welcomes, `marmot.transport.nostr.routing.v1`-backed kind `445` group messages,
  invite group evolution, insufficient acks, publish errors, subscription gating, duplicate delivery, reordered delivery,
  invite commit/welcome order variants, and terminal stale-epoch invite commits through the real session, adapter, and
  peeler stack. Production relay auth, relay safety policy, full KeyPackage metadata derivation through the transport
  layer, and account key-management wiring still need integration. The opt-in relay-telemetry export pipeline is built:
local visibility via `wn relay-stats`, an opt-in index→identity resolution boundary, a relay-plane rollup, and an
opt-in OTLP exporter (wire encoding behind the `marmot-app` `otlp-export` feature) — all aggregate, off by default, and
carrying relay identity as the sole label. Wiring its periodic push into a long-running host against the production
first-party endpoint remains ops work; see [`../relay-observability.md`](../relay-observability.md).
- **Nostr account transport shape** — the likely production shape includes a Nostr user directory, account bootstrap for
  relay-list events, a shared multi-account relay plane, `marmot.transport.nostr.routing.v1` group routing, and explicit
  relay URL safety policy. This is captured as a working note in
  [`nostr-account-transport.md`](./nostr-account-transport.md), but it should not pull focus away from the engine work.
- **Byte-level and scenario vector maturity** — the simulator has a growing portable scenario fixture set, generated
  chaos families, and a runner that writes JSON reports with expectation failures plus generated fixture candidates.
  `convergence-chaos/v1` is the first convergence-focused generated family with built-in semantic expectations, 20+
  client stress cases, mixed message/commit storms, and conservative generated-failure minimization. The byte-level
  vector plan is still thin beyond the first app-component encoding fixtures.
- **whitenoise-rs integration map** — the first integration path is likely a shim over `cgka-session` /
  `marmot-account`, with whitenoise-rs keeping account setup, Nostr directory state, relay-list repair, and shared relay
  plane ownership. The current friction points are tracked in
  [`whitenoise-integration-map.md`](./whitenoise-integration-map.md).
- **Deep same-epoch app-message reordering** — the seeded stack-chaos runner keeps generated app-message reordering
  shallow. A deeper generated reversal exposed OpenMLS `TooDistantInThePast` behavior in the message generation secret
  tree. We need an explicit policy for how much same-epoch app-message reordering the transport/session layer promises
  to tolerate, and how to classify messages outside that window.
- **Portable fork-recovery vectors** — `group-data-fork-recovery/v1` and `concurrent-invite-fork-recovery/v1` are
  semantic fixtures. They check recovery outcomes without requiring exact randomized MLS commit bytes. Exact byte
  fixtures remain for deterministic encodings and transport shapes.
- **Safe Extensions framework support** — still gated on backend library support and migration design.
- **`IdentityRemove` proposal type** — identified as the first likely Marmot-custom proposal, not specified or
  implemented.
- **KeyPackage refresh scheduling** — still a higher-layer production scheduling concern. The engine validates transported
  KeyPackage lifetime validity and range policy; product/session orchestration owns proactive refresh cadence.
